Hello there, I'm Amy HuangðŸ‘‹ â€” a former investment banker who transitioned into tech after three years in finance. **I'm deeply passionate about both finance and technology**, and especially fascinated by how they intersect to shape the future.

To pursue this interest, I moved to Japan and graduated from the [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/) coding bootcamp, where I built full-stack web applications using **Ruby on Rails**, **JavaScript**, and **front-end technologies**. Iâ€™m now excited to continue building products that make a positive impact in the world. âœ¨

I'm always eager to learn new skills and explore different areas of tech. Along the way, I even built my own [blog](https://404-peace-not-found.ghost.io/) to document everything I've learned on this exciting journey. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or just have a chat â€” Iâ€™d love to hear from you!

P.S. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me dancing to K-pop choreography ðŸ’ƒ
